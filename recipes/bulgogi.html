        <h3>Tenderness at its finest</h3>
        <p>Bulgogi is a famous easy-to-cook dish in Korea where you marinate thin slices of meat with different spices. After marination, the meat is tossed into a hot pan to be stir fried until the meat is tender and cooked</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 and 1/2 pound meat of your choice</li>
            <li>1/2 small pear, peeled and coarsely grated</li>
            <li>1/4 cup reduced sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon gochujang (Korean red pepper paste)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil (Separated)</li>
            <li>2 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Wrap steak in plastic wrap, and place in the freezer for 30 minutes. Unwrap and slice across the grain into 1/4-inch thick slices.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine pear, soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, garlic, ginger and gochujang. In a gallon size Ziploc bag, combine soy sauce mixture and steak; marinate for at least 2 hours to overnight, turning the bag occasionally.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a cast iron grill pan over medium-high heat.* Working in batches, add steak to the grill pan in a single layer and cook, flipping once, until charred and cooked through, about 2-3 minutes per side. Repeat with remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and steak.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately, garnished with green onions and sesame seeds, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
